# Clojure Score Keeper Kata

## Description

Inspired by [kata-log.rocks](http://kata-log.rocks/score-keeper-kata)

We need software to deliver the proper data to the scoreboard for a basketball team. Unfortunately the people using our software are not the brightest lights under the sun, so they need six buttons (each team can score either 1, 2 or 3 points with a single shot).


### Your task
Write a class ScoreKeeper which offers following methods:

* scoreTeamA1
* scoreTeamA2
* scoreTeamA3
* scoreTeamB1
* scoreTeamB2
* scoreTeamB3
* getScore

### Rules
The returned String always has seven characters. An example would be 000:000
